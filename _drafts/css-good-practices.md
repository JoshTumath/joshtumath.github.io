1. Use inheritance for setting things like font size rather than setting it on each individual element. 
[a project where root text size is 10px and every element is having a larger text size set on it]

2. Use inheritance for form inputs instead of repeating the same font info, etc

3. Use `:link` `:visited` instead of `a`
[talk about `:any-link` property]
