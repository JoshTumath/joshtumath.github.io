Unfortunately, the last sprint took much longer than I hoped, due to reasons I mentioned in the retrospective. However, the last sprint involved much planning anyway, so this is where we get into the real coding now. Exciting!

## Goals for this sprint
* Produce a poster about the project for [CS382](http://www.aber.ac.uk/en/modules/deptcurrent/?m=CS38220).
* Think about the Mid-Project demo.
* Implement user accounts.

## How will it get done?
I will be working on the poster over the weekend while I am away in Aberporth.

I plan to use a wireframe to plan the design of the user forms. I may use CRC cards to aid in planning the structure of the code.
