This Friday meeting, we discussed everyone’s progress, and one team member gave a presentation on UML sequence diagrams.

After the meeting, we received feedback from our client on the Project Plan, which I planned to discussed in the Wednesday meeting. However, as I was invited to a birthday meal during that time, I wasn’t able to attend. I asked the Deputy Project Leader to lead the meeting. Beforehand, I modified the gantt chart based on the feedback.

**Hours this week:** 3  
**Total hours:** 20
