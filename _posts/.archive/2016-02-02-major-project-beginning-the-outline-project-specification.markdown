## What's done
Last week, I've been doing a lot of preparatory work to get this project off the ground:

* Met up with my supervisor on Thursday to discuss a very rough draft of the agile project management system's requirements, and to plan what I will be working on this week.
* Set up a new VPS running nginx
    * Installed Node.js and Ghost on the server and migrated my personal website to the Ghost blog.
* Written an [introductory blog post](https://joshtumath.uk/2016/02/02/major-project-starting-off/), explaining the background for the project and why I'm doing it.

There have been a few things taking up my time last week, which pushed me to get things done much later than planned.

## What's next
This week will be focused on completing the Outline Project Specification. Some of this can be adapted from my rough draft of the project requirements that I presented to my supervisor.

I will also want to find a suitable tool to help me to track progress in the project. As I want to set out the requirements for the project in the form of story cards, [Trello](https://trello.com) and [Taiga](https://taiga.io) are possibilities.

Finally, I will need to consider what development methodology I will be using for the project (which will, of course, be an agile one!) and what programming language I intend to use on the server-side (most likely PHP, but I am also considering JavaScript with Node.js).

I am heavily constrained for time this week and the next, as the Christian Union (a society I am a member of) is putting on a fortnight of important events that I need to help with.
