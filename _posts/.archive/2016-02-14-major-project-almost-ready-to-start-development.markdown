## What's done
This week has been very busy for me, due to helping out with the [Christian Union](http://aberchristianunion.org.uk/)'s mission week. However, I was able to get some work done:

* I received the conference proceeding that I ordered from the library. I got it early in the week, and excitedly read it. I blogged about [what I discovered from the paper](/2016/02/12/major-project-scrum-at-cimex-media/).
* I created an initial list of user stories which are being tracked on the [project page in Taiga](https://tree.taiga.io/project/joshtumath-smallscrum/).
* I have created a Gantt chart. It just wouldn't be a Major Project without the all important Gantt chart...! The chart shows the (currently tentative) dates of sprints and the milestones and deadlines for the project.

## What's next
I will be starting off Sprint 0. I will make a blog post at the start of next week about what needs to be done.
