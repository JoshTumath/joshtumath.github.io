Today was another good day. All work on both the Web site and Android is now mostly complete. Finalising the communication from the app to the Web site is now the final remaining point (plus a few small things).

Today, I worked on finalising the design of the Web site and prepared a formal review document for the software verification review, which I decided to organise for us to do on Wednesday afternoon.

**Hours today:** 7  
**Total hours:** 45
