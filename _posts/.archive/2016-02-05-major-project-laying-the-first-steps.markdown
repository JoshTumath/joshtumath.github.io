## What's done
My Outline Project Specification is now completed and submitted. I hope to have it hosted online somewhere soon.

While searching for relevant papers, there was one I came across that was particularly useful. The conference proceeding, entitled *[Design and Development in the “Agile Room”: Trialing Scrum at a Digital Agency](http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-642-13054-0_40)* looked very interesting. The abstract mentions they were trialling Scrum at a digital agency in London called Cimex. I don't currently have access to the paper at the University's library, so I've requested it. I was going to try and contact the company, but apparently they've gone into liquidation in 2012! That's two years after the proceeding was published. That's not a positive sign...

## What's next
* **Produce a gantt chart.** My supervisor believes it would be useful for me to prepare some plan like a gantt chart to have a rough idea of how to time the development work for the project - with deadlines and presentation dates also noted down. 
* **Creating user stories for each of the requirements.** I have already created a more general bullet point list of requirements for my supervisor, but this will allow me to create a more thorough list with use cases applied to them. 
* **Spike work for looking into frameworks to use for the project.** I want to make sure the software has a good user experience, so whatever framework I use needs to enable loading of page content through AJAX. However, I also want to make sure I follow the principals of [Progressive Enhancement](https://joshtumath.uk/2013/08/12/the-importance-of-progressive-enhancement/) when developing this Web app, so it's important to make sure that there is a fallback to server-side generation of pages.
* Once the library get back to me, I can use the conference proceeding to help me start writing an example to include in my final report.

I am once again constrained for time next week, as the Christian Union (a society I am a member of) is putting on a fortnight of important events that I need to help with.
