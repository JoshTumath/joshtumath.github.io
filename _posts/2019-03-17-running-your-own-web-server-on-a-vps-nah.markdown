For the past three years, I've been running this website on a really cheap
<abbr title="Virtual Private Server">VPS</abbr> from [OVH](https://ovh.co.uk/).
It was very helpful when I was originally learning how to set up and maintain
a Web server, but I don't really have the time to maintain anything like that
any more. (Actually, I'd just much rather do something more fun!)

So I've migrated the blog from Ghost to a more basic static website created
with Jekyll and hosted on GitHub Pages. I've also archived some old blog posts
from my Uni days which probably aren't very interesting to anyone except me.

(Also, first blog post in about a year and a half! Hooray!)
