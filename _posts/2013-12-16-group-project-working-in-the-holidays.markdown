On the 14th of December was our last meeting of the year. We presented our prototypes to our Project Manager, who indicated he was very pleased with the progress we have made so far. I was also pleased by the amount of progress the Web site development team have made, so I told them they probably don’t need to work over Christmas. However, the Android team are larger and yet have done very little in comparison, so will need to work over Christmas to catch up.

And I’ll need to make sure they do so… but that’s going to be difficult when I have just one week to do my Christmas shopping. :P
