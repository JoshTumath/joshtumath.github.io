During this Friday meeting, we did a final checkover of the Testing Specification. We determined it wasnâ€™t submittable in its current state, we decided to make some final alterations after the meeting. Also, we discussed starting the Design Specification and prototypes. I asked our Chief Architect to start prototyping the Android app with the Android development team. Similarly, I asked our Deputy QA Manager to begin work on the database and Web site.

During our Wednesday meeting, I just wanted to check how everyone was doing so far. Everyone was making good progress.

**Hours this week:** 2
