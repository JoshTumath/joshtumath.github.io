And with that, the group project is over. I got the group together last Friday to work on the final documentation. Integration and testing week proved how much the group enjoy and find it easier to work together. Many of the sections were completed by the end of the session, but there was still a bit left to do.

Following this, we met again at 6pm today to finalise the documents. Our QA Manager did a great job leading a meeting beforehand to prepare everyone.

We were very relieved to finally see the project completed. Iâ€™ve really enjoyed the experience and have been very fortunate to be working with such a committed and enthusiastic team. They certainly made my job as Project Leader a lot easier!

**Hours this week:** 6  
**Total hours:** 78
