Wireframes are important for exploring the way in which data is presented to the user, before a design for the page is thought up.

In time for the Mid-Project Demonstration, I have prepared two wireframes for the user stories page.

![The first wireframe shows the user stories laid out in a grid. The second shows them laid out in rows. Both wireframes include a sidebar for storing the backlog and a dropdown menu for specifying what order to sort them in.](/content/images/2016/04/user-stories.png)
