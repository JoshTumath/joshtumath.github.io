The website has been upgraded to HTTP/2.0, which delivers a much snappier experience when downloading Web pages.

This was made possible by a server upgrade to Ubuntu 16.04, which contains a newer version of Nginx. Nginx is the Web server application that handles connections to the server. [Just with a simple configuration file change](https://www.nginx.com/blog/nginx-1-9-5/), HTTP/2.0 was supported instantly. Awesome stuff!
