My group project at Aberystwyth University has started: to work with a team to go through the entire software development process (specifying, designing, implementing and testing) to create an app for Android phones.

We’re working to create an Android app that tracks routes that users walk on to create a map of their route. They can then mark certain landmarks on the route and share the route online.

This is a large project that will require learning Android SDK APIs, Google Maps APIs and SQL syntax.

Our team will be meeting officially on Fridays. Our first meeting went well as we got to know each other and discussed each other’s attributes and skills.

We are now in the process of deciding roles. I set up a Facebook group for discussions, as this provides a good means of checking our discussion history.

**Hours this week:** 1  
**Total hours:** 1
