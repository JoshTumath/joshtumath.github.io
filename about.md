Wow, you're actually reading this! Hi! Thanks for checking out my blog.

I'm what's called a 'Graduate Software Engineer' at the BBC on their [Software Engineering Graduate Scheme](http://www.bbc.co.uk/careers/trainee-schemes-and-apprenticeships/technology/software-engineering-graduate-scheme). I'm based in [MediaCityUK](http://mediacityuk.co.uk/), [Salford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salford) and live in the area, but I'm originally from [Chester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chester). I'm a graduate from [Aberystwyth University](https://www.aber.ac.uk/), where I studied [Computer Science](https://courses.aber.ac.uk/undergraduate/computer-science-degree-with-industrial-year/).

I am a full stack developer but most interested in Web standards, Web applications, front-end development and service design! I've been dabbling with the Web platform since the age of 10; back when 2004 when it wasn't as stable and fully featured as it is now!

My main Web browser is the quality [Firefox Nightly](https://www.firefox.com), so I often submit bug reports to [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/) if I come across any. I sometimes also make proposals or contribute to discussions in Web standards bodies.

I'm also a [Christian](https://billygraham.org/story/what-is-a-christian/), a member of [City Church Manchester](http://www.citychurchmanchester.org/), a massive [Disney Parks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney_Imagineering) fan and a lover of [bourbon biscuits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourbon_biscuit).
