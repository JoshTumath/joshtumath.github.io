Wow, you're actually reading this! Hi! Thanks for checking out my blog.

I'm a Software Engineer at the BBC working in the Web Core team
who are rebuilding the entire website to work on a common framework and
platform. Its exciting stuff! I'm based in [MediaCityUK](http://mediacityuk.co.uk/),
[Salford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salford). I'm a graduate from
[Aberystwyth University](https://www.aber.ac.uk/), where I studied
[Computer Science](https://courses.aber.ac.uk/undergraduate/computer-science-degree-with-industrial-year/).

I am a full stack developer but most interested in Web standards, Web
applications, front-end development and service design! I've been dabbling with
the Web platform since the age of 10; back when 2004 when it wasn't as stable
and fully featured as it is now!

I'm also a [Christian](https://talksat.withgoogle.com/talk/making-sense-of-god-an-invitation-to-the-skeptical),
a member of [City Church Manchester](http://www.citychurchmanchester.org/), a
massive [Disney Parks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney_Imagineering)
fan and I think that [bourbon biscuits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourbon_biscuit)
are the best of all biscuits!
