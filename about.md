Wow, you're actually reading this! Hi! Thanks for checking out my blog.

I'm what's called a Software Engineer at the BBC working in the Web Core team
who are rebuilding our entire website to work on a common framework and
platform. I'm based in [MediaCityUK](http://mediacityuk.co.uk/),
[Salford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salford) and live in the area, but I'm
originally from [Chester](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chester). I'm a graduate
from [Aberystwyth University](https://www.aber.ac.uk/), where I studied
[Computer Science](https://courses.aber.ac.uk/undergraduate/computer-science-degree-with-industrial-year/).

I am a full stack developer but most interested in Web standards, Web
applications, front-end development and service design! I've been dabbling with
the Web platform since the age of 10; back when 2004 when it wasn't as stable
and fully featured as it is now!

I'm also a [Christian](https://billygraham.org/story/what-is-a-christian/), a
member of [City Church Manchester](http://www.citychurchmanchester.org/), a
massive [Disney Parks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney_Imagineering)
fan and a lover of [bourbon biscuits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourbon_biscuit).
